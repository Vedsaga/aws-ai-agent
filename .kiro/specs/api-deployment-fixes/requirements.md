# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical deployment issues preventing the Multi-Agent Orchestration System APIs from functioning. While infrastructure deployment succeeded (100% of AWS resources created), Lambda functions cannot execute due to missing Python dependencies, resulting in only 4.2% test pass rate. This spec focuses on fixing Lambda dependency bundling, database initialization, and achieving 100% API functionality for frontend integration.

## Glossary

- **Lambda Function**: AWS serverless compute service that runs code in response to events
- **PythonFunction**: AWS CDK construct that automatically bundles Python dependencies with Lambda functions
- **psycopg**: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python, required for RDS connectivity
- **CDK Stack**: AWS Cloud Development Kit infrastructure-as-code definition
- **VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud, isolated network environment in AWS
- **RDS**: Relational Database Service, managed PostgreSQL database
- **API Gateway**: AWS service that creates, publishes, and manages REST APIs
- **CloudWatch**: AWS monitoring and logging service
- **DynamoDB**: AWS NoSQL database service
- **Cognito**: AWS authentication and user management service
- **Lambda Layer**: Reusable code package that can be attached to Lambda functions
- **Security Group**: Virtual firewall controlling inbound and outbound traffic
- **Seed Data**: Initial data loaded into database for testing and demo purposes
- **Test Suite**: Automated tests validating API functionality (TEST.py)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Infrastructure Configuration

**User Story:** As a cloud architect, I want Lambda functions properly configured within VPC, so that they can securely access RDS and other AWS services

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System deploys db-init Lambda function, THE System SHALL place function in same VPC as RDS cluster
2. WHEN THE System configures db-init Lambda, THE System SHALL attach security group allowing outbound traffic to RDS on port 5432
3. WHEN THE System configures Lambda functions requiring RDS access, THE System SHALL provide RDS cluster ARN and secret ARN as environment variables
4. WHEN THE System configures Lambda functions requiring DynamoDB access, THE System SHALL provide table names as environment variables
5. WHEN THE System deploys Lambda functions, THE System SHALL grant IAM permissions for accessing required AWS services

### Requirement 2: Lambda Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Lambda functions to automatically bundle Python dependencies, so that functions can execute without import errors

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System deploys Agent Handler Lambda, THE System SHALL bundle psycopg module with the function code
2. WHEN THE System deploys Domain Handler Lambda, THE System SHALL bundle psycopg module with the function code
3. WHEN THE System deploys Session Handler Lambda, THE System SHALL bundle required dependencies with the function code
4. WHEN THE System invokes any Lambda function, THE System SHALL successfully import all required Python modules without Runtime.ImportModuleError
5. WHEN THE System builds Lambda deployment packages, THE System SHALL exclude development files including test files, virtual environments, and cache directories

### Requirement 3: Deployment Verification

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want automated verification after deployment, so that I can confirm system readiness before frontend integration

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System completes CDK deployment, THE System SHALL verify all CloudFormation stacks show CREATE_COMPLETE or UPDATE_COMPLETE status
2. WHEN THE System completes deployment, THE System SHALL verify all Lambda functions are in Active state
3. WHEN THE System completes deployment, THE System SHALL invoke db-init Lambda and verify successful completion
4. WHEN THE System completes deployment, THE System SHALL execute full test suite and capture results
5. WHEN THE System identifies test failures, THE System SHALL capture CloudWatch logs for failed Lambda invocations
6. WHEN THE System completes verification, THE System SHALL generate deployment report with pass/fail status for each component

### Requirement 4: Database Initialization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database to initialize successfully within VPC constraints, so that schema and seed data are properly loaded

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System invokes db-init Lambda function, THE System SHALL complete execution within 600 seconds without timeout
2. WHEN THE db-init Lambda executes, THE System SHALL connect to RDS cluster within the VPC
3. WHEN THE db-init Lambda connects to RDS, THE System SHALL create all required database tables according to schema.sql
4. WHEN THE db-init Lambda completes schema creation, THE System SHALL load builtin agent definitions from seed data
5. WHEN THE db-init Lambda completes, THE System SHALL return success status code 200 with confirmation message

### Requirement 5: Test Suite Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the test suite to achieve 100% pass rate, so that I can verify all APIs are production-ready

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System executes TEST.py in deployed mode, THE System SHALL pass all authentication tests
2. WHEN THE System executes TEST.py in deployed mode, THE System SHALL pass all agent CRUD operation tests
3. WHEN THE System executes TEST.py in deployed mode, THE System SHALL pass all domain CRUD operation tests
4. WHEN THE System executes TEST.py in deployed mode, THE System SHALL pass all report submission tests
5. WHEN THE System executes TEST.py in deployed mode, THE System SHALL pass all session management tests
6. WHEN THE System executes TEST.py in deployed mode, THE System SHALL pass all query execution tests
7. WHEN THE System completes TEST.py execution, THE System SHALL report 100% pass rate with zero failures
8. WHEN THE System completes TEST.py execution, THE System SHALL display "READY FOR DEMO" status

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a support engineer, I want comprehensive error logging, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Lambda function encounters import error, THE System SHALL log error message to CloudWatch with module name and traceback
2. WHEN THE Lambda function encounters database connection error, THE System SHALL log error message with connection details and timeout duration
3. WHEN THE Lambda function encounters authorization error, THE System SHALL log error message with request headers and expected format
4. WHEN THE API Gateway receives request, THE System SHALL log request method, path, and response status code
5. WHEN THE System encounters any error during deployment, THE System SHALL preserve error logs for minimum 7 days in CloudWatch
