# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the functional requirements for the Command Center Backend API. The primary goal is to provide a robust, serverless API that serves simulation data from a 7-day pre-processed timeline and leverages an AI agent powered by Amazon Bedrock to respond to natural language queries. The backend acts as the data and intelligence layer for the Command Center Dashboard, enabling real-time event updates and intelligent query processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Endpoint Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a secure and well-defined REST API, so that I can reliably integrate the Command Center Dashboard with the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is deployed THEN the system SHALL expose a secure REST API through Amazon API Gateway
2. WHEN a client makes a request THEN the system SHALL enforce authentication using API keys
3. WHEN a client makes a cross-origin request THEN the system SHALL properly handle CORS headers
4. WHEN the API receives requests THEN the system SHALL provide three specific endpoints: `POST /agent/query`, `POST /agent/action`, and `GET /data/updates`
5. WHEN any endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return responses conforming exactly to the defined JSON data contract structures

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Event Updates Endpoint

**User Story:** As a Command Center operator, I want to retrieve event updates based on time and domain filters, so that I can see the latest incidents and resource changes in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client calls `GET /data/updates` with a `since` timestamp THEN the system SHALL return all events that occurred after that timestamp
2. WHEN a client calls `GET /data/updates` with a `domain` filter THEN the system SHALL return only events matching that domain (MEDICAL, FIRE, STRUCTURAL, LOGISTICS, COMMUNICATION)
3. WHEN a client calls `GET /data/updates` with both `since` and `domain` parameters THEN the system SHALL apply both filters
4. WHEN the updates endpoint queries data THEN the system SHALL execute the query in under 500ms for typical loads
5. WHEN the updates endpoint returns data THEN the system SHALL format the response as a lean JSON structure with only essential fields

### Requirement 3: Natural Language Query Processing

**User Story:** As a Command Center operator, I want to ask questions in natural language about the disaster situation, so that I can quickly get insights without writing complex queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a `POST /agent/query` request with natural language text THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock to interpret the user's intent
2. WHEN the Bedrock Agent processes a query THEN the system SHALL determine what information is needed from the simulation database
3. WHEN the Bedrock Agent needs data THEN the system SHALL invoke its configured Action Group tool to query DynamoDB
4. WHEN the Bedrock Agent retrieves data THEN the system SHALL synthesize the information into a coherent natural language response
5. WHEN the query processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return a structured JSON payload containing the `chatResponse` and any relevant `mapUpdates` or `events`
6. WHEN the Bedrock Agent cannot answer a query THEN the system SHALL provide a helpful explanation of what information is unavailable

### Requirement 4: Pre-Defined Action Execution

**User Story:** As a Command Center operator, I want to execute pre-defined actions (like "show all critical medical incidents"), so that I can quickly access common queries without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a `POST /agent/action` request with an `actionId` THEN the system SHALL map the action to a specific query intent
2. WHEN the action handler processes a request THEN the system SHALL invoke the Bedrock Agent with the appropriate context
3. WHEN the action requires database queries THEN the system SHALL use the same Action Group tool as natural language queries
4. WHEN the action execution is complete THEN the system SHALL return the same structured JSON format as the query endpoint
5. WHEN an invalid `actionId` is provided THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message

### Requirement 5: Simulation Timeline Data Storage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the entire 7-day simulation timeline stored efficiently, so that the API can serve historical and real-time data quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN the database SHALL contain all pre-processed events from the 7-day simulation timeline
2. WHEN events are stored THEN the system SHALL use a partition key strategy that enables efficient time-range queries
3. WHEN events are stored THEN the system SHALL include all required attributes: eventId, timestamp, domain, severity, geojson, summary
4. WHEN the database is queried by time range THEN the system SHALL leverage DynamoDB's sort key for optimal performance
5. WHEN the database is queried by domain THEN the system SHALL use a Global Secondary Index for efficient filtering

### Requirement 6: AI Agent Tool Integration

**User Story:** As the Bedrock Agent, I want access to a database query tool, so that I can retrieve the specific data needed to answer user questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Bedrock Agent needs data THEN the system SHALL provide an Action Group tool called `databaseQueryTool`
2. WHEN the Agent invokes the tool THEN the system SHALL accept structured parameters like domain, severity, time range, and location filters
3. WHEN the tool receives parameters THEN the system SHALL execute the appropriate DynamoDB query
4. WHEN the tool completes the query THEN the system SHALL return raw data back to the Agent for synthesis
5. WHEN the tool encounters an error THEN the system SHALL return a structured error message that the Agent can interpret

### Requirement 7: Scalability and Performance

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the backend to handle variable traffic patterns efficiently, so that the system remains responsive during both quiet periods and high-load scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale using serverless Lambda functions
2. WHEN traffic decreases THEN the system SHALL scale down to minimize costs
3. WHEN the updates endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL respond in under 500ms for 95% of requests
4. WHEN the agent query endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL respond in under 3 seconds for 95% of requests
5. WHEN DynamoDB is queried THEN the system SHALL use efficient query patterns to minimize read capacity consumption
6. WHEN the system experiences errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging without exposing sensitive data to clients
