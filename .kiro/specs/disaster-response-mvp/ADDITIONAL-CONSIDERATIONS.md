1. Moderate building damage (cluster 0 nearby)
2. Main access road intact (easier to reach)
3. Large residential population (200+ families)
4. Limited warehouse coverage (nearest is 3 km)

Suggestion: Consider establishing distribution point in northern area.
```

### 9. Multi-Language Chat Interface
**What:** Operators can chat in their preferred language
