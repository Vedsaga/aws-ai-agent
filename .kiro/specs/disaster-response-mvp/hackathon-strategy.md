## 🚀 Core Winning Feature: Autonomous AI Map Control

### What Makes It Special
Most disaster response systems require manual map manipulation. Our AI agent:
1. **Understands query intent** using Bedrock Nova reasoning
2. **Decides optimal visualization** (zoom, center, polygons)
3. **Generates dynamic overlays** from unstructured data
4. **Explains its reasoning** to build operator trust

### Demo Queries to Showcase
1. **Simple:** "Show me food shortage areas"
   - AI zooms to city level, generates density polygons

2. **Complex:** "Compare medicine requests near damaged buildings vs. safe zones"
   - AI creates two polygon layers with different colors
   - AI provides analytical insights on distribution patterns

3. **Specific:** "Focus on OSM building 1138689421 and show all reports within 500 meters"
   - AI zooms to exact building coordinates
   - AI draws 500m radius circle
   - AI lists relevant reports with timestamps

4. **Temporal:** "Show me rescue team movements in the last 6 hours"
   - AI filters data by time
   - AI generates movement paths
   - AI highlights current positions

5. **Multi-factor:** "Where do we need blood type A+ urgently near cluster 0?"
   - AI combines: resource type + urgency + location + damage context
   - AI generates targeted visualization
   - AI suggests nearest warehouses with blood supplies
