# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Disaster Response MVP system, focusing on building a comprehensive solution that includes a rescue team mobile application, helpline center processing pipeline, and real-time dashboard. The system will simulate the 2023 Turkey February earthquake response for Nurdağı city, processing emergency calls through multi-agent AI pipelines and providing real-time data visualization. The system must be modular, resilient to high load, and deployable through a single script. The MVP excludes drone feeds and social media processing but maintains the architectural foundation for future expansion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a rescue team member (including NGO teams and international rescue units), I want a mobile application to submit text reports and receive notifications, so that I can efficiently coordinate during disaster response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rescue team member opens the mobile app THEN the system SHALL display their current location on Nurdağı city map and nearby active incidents
2. WHEN a rescue team member submits a text report THEN the system SHALL process it through multi-agent pipeline and extract structured incident data
3. WHEN a rescue team member submits an incident report THEN the system SHALL capture location, incident type, severity, resource needs, and timestamp with automatic translation support
4. WHEN the command center publishes a notification THEN the system SHALL distribute it globally or based on proximity and criticality filters
5. WHEN a rescue team member views notifications THEN the system SHALL show filtered notifications with contact information and criticality level

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system processing emergency reports, I want to extract critical information from text transcripts through multi-agent pipeline, so that command center operators can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a text report is received THEN the system SHALL process it through the multi-agent pipeline
2. WHEN the multi-agent pipeline processes a transcript THEN the system SHALL extract incident type, location coordinates, severity level, required resources, temporal references, and contact information
3. WHEN location information is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL use the geo-intelligence agent to resolve addresses to precise coordinates using OSM data
4. WHEN the system detects temporal references THEN the system SHALL extract and normalize time expressions adaptively
5. WHEN the system processes complex scenarios THEN the system SHALL use Bedrock Nova for advanced reasoning and context understanding
6. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a structured JSON output with all extracted information and confidence scores

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a command center operator, I want an AI agent that controls the map dynamically based on my natural language queries, so that I can visualize complex disaster response data without manual map manipulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the operator asks a natural language question THEN the AI agent SHALL autonomously control map zoom, center, and polygon overlays to visualize the answer
2. WHEN the operator queries about resource distribution THEN the AI agent SHALL generate density polygons, adjust zoom level, and highlight relevant areas automatically
3. WHEN the operator uses the time slider (14-minute browser timeline = 7 simulation days) THEN the system SHALL show data progression with temporal filtering
4. WHEN the operator asks about specific buildings THEN the AI agent SHALL zoom to OSM building coordinates and overlay relevant incident data
5. WHEN the operator asks comparative questions THEN the AI agent SHALL create multiple polygon layers with different colors and provide analytical insights
6. WHEN the operator requests to save a view THEN the AI agent SHALL create a named snapshot with all map state and query context
7. WHEN the operator publishes a notification THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by proximity, criticality, and global distribution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want modular automated pipelines that gracefully handle system resource constraints, so that the system remains stable during high load by queuing tasks instead of crashing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new emergency call data arrives in the system THEN the ingestion pipeline SHALL automatically trigger processing within 30 seconds
2. WHEN the system experiences resource constraints THEN the system SHALL queue pending tasks instead of failing or crashing
3. WHEN the multi-agent pipeline completes processing THEN the system SHALL automatically store results in the appropriate databases
4. WHEN processed data is stored THEN the system SHALL automatically update the serving layer for dashboard consumption
5. WHEN any pipeline component fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and route the data to a dead letter queue for manual review
6. IF system resources become available THEN the system SHALL automatically process queued tasks in priority order

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a rescue team coordinator, I want to track team locations and assignments in real-time, so that I can optimize resource deployment and ensure team safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rescue teams are active THEN the system SHALL track and display their real-time locations on the dashboard
2. WHEN a team is assigned to an incident THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the estimated arrival time
3. WHEN a team reports completion of an assignment THEN the system SHALL update their status to available and log the completion time
4. WHEN a team hasn't reported status for over 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL flag them for welfare check
5. IF a team requests backup THEN the system SHALL identify and suggest the nearest available teams

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a single deployment script that sets up the entire system, so that the disaster response system can be activated quickly in emergency situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment script is executed THEN the system SHALL automatically provision all AWS resources including Lambda functions, databases, and API gateways
2. WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL be fully operational with all components connected and configured
3. WHEN the script encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities
4. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the system SHALL include pre-loaded Turkey earthquake simulation data for Nurdağı city
5. IF the deployment script is run multiple times THEN the system SHALL handle idempotent operations without creating duplicate resources
