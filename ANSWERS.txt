QUICK ANSWERS
=============

Q1: Does real-time work for chat (submit, clarify, query)?
A1: NO - AppSync NOT deployed. Code exists but needs 30 min deployment.
    Alternative: Polling works fine (checks every 2 seconds).

Q2: Is AppSync deployed?
A2: NO. We wrote all the code but didn't deploy the API.
    Reason: Out of time, polling is good enough for now.

Q3: How does React frontend work?
A3: NEW FILES CREATED:
    - components/IncidentChat.tsx (full chat UI)
    - lib/incident-api.ts (API client with polling)
    - app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx (chat page)
    
    Works now: Submit reports, query, see results
    Uses: Polling instead of real-time

Q4: Chat history on refresh?
A4: NO - Not implemented.
    On refresh: Chat clears (no persistence)
    
    To add (2 hours):
    - Create ChatSessions DynamoDB table
    - Add 3 API endpoints (list/load/save)
    - Update IncidentChat to save each message
    - Use localStorage for session_id

WHAT WORKS NOW (45 min demo ready):
====================================

‚úÖ Chat UI - Beautiful, responsive
‚úÖ Submit reports - POST /api/v1/ingest
‚úÖ Query incidents - POST /api/v1/query
‚úÖ Status polling - Checks every 2 seconds
‚úÖ Results display - Shows location, time, category
‚úÖ Error handling - Timeouts, retries

‚ùå NO chat persistence
‚ùå NO real-time (using polling instead)

DEMO FLOW:
==========

1. Open: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/chat
2. Type: "Pothole at Main Street"
3. See: "üìù Submitting..." ‚Üí "‚è≥ Processing..." ‚Üí "‚úÖ Success!"
4. Type: "Show all pothole reports"
5. See: Query results

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
==================

Polling Strategy:
- Check status every 2 seconds
- Max 60 attempts (2 minutes)
- Fallback to checking incidents table
- Shows processing spinner
- Updates message in place

Authentication:
- Uses existing Cognito token
- No changes needed

State Management:
- React useState
- Messages array in memory
- Lost on refresh (no persistence)

TO GO PRODUCTION:
=================

Option 1: Keep Polling (15 min)
- Works now
- Good enough for hackathon
- No additional deployment

Option 2: Deploy AppSync (30 min)
- Better UX
- Real-time updates
- Run: cd infrastructure && npx cdk deploy MultiAgentOrchestration-dev-Realtime

Option 3: Add Chat History (2 hours)
- Needs new table
- Needs 3 API endpoints
- Frontend updates

RECOMMENDATION: Use what's built (polling)
