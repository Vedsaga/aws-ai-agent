CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED
========================

1. ✅ INFINITE LOOP FIXED
   - File: components/DomainSelector.tsx
   - Issue: loadDomains in useEffect deps caused infinite re-renders
   - Fix: Moved function inside useEffect, deps = []
   - Result: API called only ONCE on mount

2. ✅ DARK MODE FIXED
   - File: components/AgentCreationForm.tsx
   - Issue: bg-white hardcoded
   - Fix: Changed to bg-card with border-border
   - Result: Form now respects dark theme

3. ✅ MAP AUTO-ZOOM ADDED
   - File: components/MapView.tsx
   - Added: autoZoomToIncidents() function
   - Calculates bounds from all incident coordinates
   - Auto-fits map with 50px padding, max zoom 15
   - Triggers after incidents load

4. ✅ MAP AUTO-LOAD
   - Incidents now load automatically on mount
   - Auto-zoom triggers after load
   - "Refresh Map" button still works

5. ✅ NAVIGATION CORRECT
   - Dashboard has "Manage Agents" button → /manage
   - "Configure Agents" removed from dashboard
   - agents/page.tsx still has both buttons (correct)

REMAINING ITEMS (NOT CRITICAL):
- Dependency graph visualization (can be done later)
- Map popups already implemented in createDetailedPopup()
- Polling already handled by AppSync subscription

TEST NOW:
cd infrastructure/frontend
npm run dev

Expected:
- No infinite API calls
- Domains load once
- Dark mode everywhere
- Map shows incidents and auto-zooms
- Click incidents for popups
