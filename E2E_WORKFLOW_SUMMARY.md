It is about 2 feet wide and 6 inches deep. 
It has been there for 2 weeks. 
Several cars have hit it and got damaged.
```

**Expected Agent Processing:**
- ✅ geo_agent → "Main Street near library"
- ✅ temporal_agent → "2 weeks ago"
- ✅ severity_agent → severity='high', size='2ft x 6in'
- ✅ priority_agent → urgency='urgent' (damage to cars)

**Status:** Submitted (202 Accepted)

### 6. Complex, Multi-Issue Report ✅
**Job ID:** `job_39b67195f45b4b67807a7c9f123e612e`

**Report:**
```
Multiple potholes on Oak Avenue between 5th and 8th Streets.
Road deteriorating for 3 months.
5-6 large potholes, biggest near 6th Street (3 feet wide).
Severe traffic problems during rush hour (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM).
Drivers swerving into opposite lane (dangerous).
School nearby (Oak Elementary), many children walk here.
Needs urgent attention before someone gets hurt.
```

**Expected Agent Processing:**
- ✅ geo_agent → "Oak Avenue (5th-8th), intersection 6th, near Oak Elementary"
- ✅ temporal_agent → "3 months deterioration, rush hour 7-9 AM, 5-7 PM"
- ✅ severity_agent → severity='critical', size='3ft', traffic_impact='severe'

Someone should fix it.
```

**Expected Agent Behavior:**
- ⚠️ geo_agent → Low confidence (no specific location)
