============================================
END-TO-END TEST RESULTS
============================================
Date: 2025-10-20
Tests: 4 scenarios (Clear, Vague, Off-topic, Valid Query)

============================================
TEST 1: CLEAR REPORT ✅ PASS
============================================

Input: "Broken streetlight on Broadway near Times Square. Not working for 3 days."

Expected:
✓ Geo-agent extracts lat/lon
✓ Temporal-agent extracts duration
✓ High confidence (no clarification)
✓ Data stored in DynamoDB

Results:
✅ geo_agent output:
   - Address: "Broadway near Times Square"
   - Lat: 40.7589
   - Lon: -73.9851
   - Confidence: 4/5 (0.8)

✅ temporal_agent output:
   - Duration: "3 days"
   - Confidence: 5/5 (1.0)

✅ Status: completed
✅ Data stored in DynamoDB

Response Structure:
{
  "job_id": "job_a6fa95dc4d034ee0a3cd1ca9b971f6b8",
  "status": "accepted",
  "message": "Report submitted for processing",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:31:07.527198"
}

VERDICT: ✅ WORKING
- Lat/lon extraction: YES
- Confidence scoring: YES
- Data storage: YES

============================================
TEST 2: VAGUE REPORT ⚠️ PARTIAL
============================================

Input: "There is a problem near the park"

Expected:
✓ Low confidence detected
✓ API returns needs_clarification
✓ Specific clarification question asked

Results:
✅ Agents executed
✅ Low confidence detected (temporal: 0.5)
⚠️  API returned standard "accepted" response
⚠️  No clarification question in response

Response Structure:
{
  "job_id": "job_0ba6c0200f0f4a81bda029652024a8f3",
  "status": "accepted",  // Should be "needs_clarification"
  "message": "Report submitted for processing"
}

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The IngestHandler returns standard response immediately.
Orchestrator processes async and detects low confidence.
But API has already responded to user.

NEEDED:
IngestHandler should wait for orchestrator verification
OR orchestrator should update a status endpoint
OR use websocket/polling for status updates

VERDICT: ⚠️ NEEDS ADJUSTMENT
- Detection: YES
- API Response: NO (returns before verification)

============================================
TEST 3: OFF-TOPIC QUERY ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED
============================================

Input: "What is the weather today?"

Expected:
✓ Agent detects out-of-scope
✓ Returns refusal message
✓ Stays in lane (civic complaints only)

Results:
✅ API accepted query
⚠️  No refusal mechanism implemented
⚠️  Query agents will try to answer

Response Structure:
{
  "job_id": "query_09b36670db5c4423aea20fc87b0fcfc3",
  "status": "accepted"
}

VERDICT: ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED
Need to add domain validation/scope checking

============================================
TEST 4: VALID QUERY ✅ PASS
============================================

Input: "Where are the streetlight issues located?"

Expected:
✓ Query agents execute
✓ where_agent analyzes locations
✓ Results returned

Results:
✅ Agents executed:
   - what_agent: confidence=1
   - where_agent: confidence=5
   - when_agent: confidence=5

✅ Job completed successfully

Response Structure:
{
  "job_id": "query_9801200eac244b279a0de946f740db47",
  "status": "accepted"
}

VERDICT: ✅ WORKING
- Query agents execute: YES
- Processing completes: YES

============================================
RESPONSE STRUCTURE COMPLIANCE
============================================

Current Structure:
{
  "job_id": "string",
  "status": "accepted",
  "message": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO date"
}

Gemini Recommended Structure:
{
  "status": "success" | "needs_clarification" | "error",
  "action": "SHOW_MESSAGE" | "ASK_QUESTION" | "UPDATE_MAP_AND_CHAT",
  "sessionId": "string",
  "data": {
    "ui": {...},
    "map": {...},
    "conversationContext": {...}
  }
}

VERDICT: ⚠️ NOT ALIGNED
Current response doesn't match recommended structure

============================================
SUMMARY
============================================

WORKING ✅:
1. Geo-agent lat/lon extraction
2. Temporal-agent duration extraction
3. Confidence scoring (0-5 scale)
4. Data storage in DynamoDB
5. Query agents execution

NEEDS WORK ⚠️:
1. Response structure (not Gemini-aligned)
2. Clarification flow (async issue)
3. Off-topic refusal (not implemented)
4. Confidence normalization (still 0-5, not 0.0-1.0 in response)
5. Amazon Location Service (code added but not used yet)

CRITICAL FOR CLIENT INTEGRATION:
1. Align response structure with Gemini spec
2. Add clarification handling in API response
3. Add domain scope validation
4. Return map data in proper format

============================================
RECOMMENDATION
============================================

Before client integration:

1. Update IngestHandler to return Gemini-aligned structure
2. Add synchronous verification step (or polling endpoint)
3. Implement domain scope checking
4. Test clarification flow with follow-up
5. Verify map data format matches frontend needs

Current Score: 65% ready for client integration
With fixes: 95% ready
