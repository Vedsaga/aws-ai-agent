# 🚨 START HERE - CRITICAL: < 6 Hours to Submission

**Current Time:** Check your clock NOW  
**Deadline:** October 20, 2025 - 5:00 PM Pacific Time  
**Status:** 🔴 APIs failing, infrastructure deployed, need fixes ASAP

---

## ⚡ SITUATION

- ✅ **Infrastructure deployed** - Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, RDS, DynamoDB all live
- ✅ **Documentation complete** - API Reference, Demo Script, Gap Analysis done
- ❌ **APIs broken** - All returning HTTP 500 errors (38/48 tests failing)
- ❌ **No working demo** - Can't demonstrate functionality yet

**Root Cause:** Lambda functions crashing (likely database connection or missing env vars)

---

## 🎯 WINNING STRATEGY

Focus on **Technical Execution (50% of score)**:
1. Fix at least 1 API endpoint (Config API)
2. Create 3-minute demo video (even if limited functionality)
3. Submit to DevPost with honest documentation

**Minimum Success = 1 working API + Demo Video + Submission**

---

## ⏱️ TIME ALLOCATION

| Hour | Task | Critical? |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Hour 1** | Diagnose & fix Lambda errors | 🔴 YES |
| **Hour 2** | Deploy simplified Config API | 🔴 YES |
| **Hour 3** | Record demo video | 🔴 YES |
| **Hour 4** | Prepare submission materials | 🟡 IMPORTANT |
| **Hour 5** | Submit to DevPost | 🔴 YES |
| **Hour 6** | Buffer for issues | 🟡 BUFFER |

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Deploy Quick Fix (30 minutes)

```bash
cd ~/hackathon/aws-ai-agent

# Deploy simplified Lambda handler
chmod +x quick_fix_deploy.sh
./quick_fix_deploy.sh

# This will:
# 1. Deploy simplified config API handler
# 2. Test with JWT token
# 3. Report success/failure
```

**Expected Result:** API returns 200 instead of 500

### Step 2: If Still Broken (15 minutes)

```bash
# Check CloudWatch logs for errors
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/MultiAgentOrchestration-dev-Api-ConfigApiHandler \
  --follow --region us-east-1

# In another terminal, trigger request
TOKEN=$(aws cognito-idp initiate-auth \
  --auth-flow USER_PASSWORD_AUTH \
  --client-id 6gobbpage9af3nd7ahm3lchkct \
  --auth-parameters USERNAME=testuser,PASSWORD=TestPassword123! \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --query 'AuthenticationResult.IdToken' \
  --output text)

curl -X GET "https://vluqfpl2zi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/api/v1/config?type=agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Action:** Copy error message, check EXECUTION_GUIDE.md for solution

### Step 3: Record Demo Video (40 minutes)

**Use:** OBS Studio or Loom  
**Length:** 3 minutes  
**Upload:** YouTube (unlisted)

**Script:**
1. (30 sec) Intro + Problem Statement
2. (1 min) Technical Demo - show working APIs or AWS Console
3. (1 min) Code & Architecture walkthrough
4. (30 sec) Impact & Innovation

See: `EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` Hour 3 for detailed script

### Step 4: Submit to DevPost (30 minutes)

1. Go to: https://aws-agent-hackathon.devpost.com/
2. Fill out submission form
3. Link: Demo video, GitHub repo, Architecture diagram
4. **CLICK SUBMIT** before 5:00 PM PT
