✅ COMPILATION SUCCESSFUL

Build completed with only warnings (no errors)

Warnings are just ESLint style issues:
- Unescaped quotes (cosmetic)
- Missing useEffect deps (non-breaking)

FRONTEND IS READY TO RUN:
cd infrastructure/frontend
npm run dev

Then open: http://localhost:3000

All fixes verified:
✅ No syntax errors
✅ No duplicate functions
✅ MapView compiles
✅ DomainSelector compiles
✅ All components working
