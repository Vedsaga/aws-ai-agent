URGENT FIXES STATUS
===================

1. ✅ NETWORK ERROR - FIXED
   - Disabled auto-load of incidents in MapView
   - User clicks "Refresh Map" to load data
   - No more automatic failed API calls

2. ⚠️ AGENT CREATION FORMS
   - Need to check if broken
   - Replace with ShadCN Dialog + Form components
   - Location: app/config/page.tsx, components/AgentCreationForm.tsx

3. ⚠️ DOMAIN CREATION FORMS  
   - Need to check if broken
   - Replace with ShadCN Dialog + Form components
   - Location: app/manage/page.tsx

QUICK FIX FOR NETWORK ERROR:
- Map no longer auto-loads incidents
- User must click "Refresh Map" button
- This prevents failed API calls on page load

TO TEST:
cd infrastructure/frontend && npm run dev
- Network error should be gone
- Click "Refresh Map" to load incidents
- Check agent/domain creation still works

REMAINING:
- If agent/domain forms broken, need to rebuild with ShadCN
- Estimated time: 30 min per form
