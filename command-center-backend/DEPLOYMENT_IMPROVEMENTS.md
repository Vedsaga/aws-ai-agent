# Deployment Script Improvements ‚úÖ

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ End-to-End Deployment with Waiting

**Problem:** Script didn't wait for deployment to complete

**Solution:** Added proper waiting mechanism with progress monitoring

```bash
# Now the script:
- Starts CDK deployment in background
- Monitors CloudFormation stack status
- Shows real-time progress updates
- Waits for completion before proceeding
- Exits with proper error codes if deployment fails
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ True end-to-end automation
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention needed
- ‚úÖ Clear progress indication
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Conflict Detection and Prevention

**Problem:** No checks for existing deployments or conflicts

**Solution:** Added pre-deployment validation

```bash
# Script now checks:
- If stack already exists
- Current stack status
- If stack is in progress (prevents conflicts)
- If stack is in failed state (provides guidance)
```

**Prevents:**
- ‚ùå Concurrent deployments
- ‚ùå Deploying over failed stacks
- ‚ùå Resource conflicts

**Example Output:**
```
‚ö† Stack already exists. This will update existing resources.
Checking for potential conflicts...
‚úì Stack is in a stable state: UPDATE_COMPLETE
```

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Easy Model Selection

**Problem:** Model was hardcoded, required code changes to switch

**Solution:** Added `--model` flag for easy switching

```bash
# Switch models easily:
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh --model anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh --model anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh --model anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No code changes needed
- ‚úÖ Test different models easily
- ‚úÖ Environment variable support
- ‚úÖ Documented in `MODEL_SELECTION.md`

---

## New Features

### Progress Monitoring

The script now shows real-time deployment progress:

```
[6/8] Deploying CDK stack...
This may take 5-10 minutes...

Monitoring deployment progress...
(This may take 5-10 minutes)

Status: CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
..........
Status: CREATE_COMPLETE
‚úì Stack deployed successfully
```

### Conflict Prevention

Checks before deployment:

```bash
# Detects in-progress deployments
‚úó Stack is currently being updated. Please wait for it to complete.
  Current status: UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS

# Detects failed states
‚úó Stack is in a failed state: ROLLBACK_COMPLETE
You need to delete the stack first:
  cdk destroy
```

### Model Configuration

Three ways to specify model:

```bash
# 1. Command line flag
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh --model MODEL_ID

# 2. Environment variable
export BEDROCK_MODEL="MODEL_ID"
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh

# 3. Inline
BEDROCK_MODEL="MODEL_ID" bash scripts/full-deploy.sh
```

## Updated Help Output

```bash
$ bash scripts/full-deploy.sh --help

Usage: bash scripts/full-deploy.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --stage STAGE           Deployment stage (default: dev)
                          Options: dev, staging, prod

  --model MODEL           Bedrock model to use (default: claude-3-sonnet)
                          Options:
                            anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0 (default)
                            anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0
                            anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0
                            anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0

  --skip-populate         Skip database population after deployment
  --skip-bootstrap-check  Skip CDK bootstrap check
  --help                  Show this help message

Examples:
  bash scripts/full-deploy.sh                                    # Deploy dev with Claude 3 Sonnet
  bash scripts/full-deploy.sh --stage prod                       # Deploy to production
  bash scripts/full-deploy.sh --model anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0  # Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet
```

## Deployment Flow

### Before (Old Script)
```
1. Check credentials ‚úì
2. Check Bedrock ‚úì
3. Bootstrap CDK ‚úì
4. Install deps ‚úì
5. Build ‚úì
6. Deploy (fire and forget) ‚ö†Ô∏è
7. Retrieve outputs (might fail if deploy not done) ‚ö†Ô∏è
8. Populate DB (might fail if deploy not done) ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

### After (New Script)
```
1. Check credentials ‚úì
2. Check Bedrock ‚úì
3. Check for conflicts ‚úì NEW
4. Bootstrap CDK ‚úì
5. Install deps ‚úì
6. Build ‚úì
7. Deploy with monitoring ‚úì IMPROVED
   - Start deployment
   - Monitor progress
   - Wait for completion
   - Verify success
8. Retrieve outputs ‚úì (guaranteed to work)
9. Populate DB ‚úì (guaranteed to work)
```

## Code Changes

### 1. Environment Configuration
**File:** `config/environment.ts`

Added `bedrockModel` to configuration:
```typescript
export interface EnvironmentConfig {
  // ... existing fields
  bedrockModel: string;  // NEW
}
```

### 2. Stack Configuration
**File:** `lib/command-center-backend-stack.ts`

Changed from hardcoded to configurable:
```typescript
// BEFORE
foundationModel: 'anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0',

// AFTER
foundationModel: config.bedrockModel,
```

### 3. Deployment Script
**File:** `scripts/full-deploy.sh`

Added:
- Model selection via `--model` flag
- Conflict detection
- Progress monitoring
- Proper waiting for completion

---

## Testing the Improvements

### Test 1: Normal Deployment
```bash
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh
# Should complete end-to-end without manual intervention
```

### Test 2: Model Selection
```bash
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh --model anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0
# Should deploy with Haiku model
```

### Test 3: Conflict Detection
```bash
# Start deployment
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh &

# Try to deploy again (should fail with conflict message)
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh
# Expected: Error about stack being updated
```

### Test 4: Redeployment
```bash
# Make a code change
# Redeploy
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh --skip-populate
# Should update only changed resources
```

## Migration Guide

### If You're Using Old Script

No changes needed! The new script is backward compatible:

```bash
# Old way (still works)
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh

# New way (with improvements)
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh --model anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0
```

### If You Have Existing Deployment

The script will detect and update:

```bash
bash scripts/full-deploy.sh
# Output: ‚ö† Stack already exists. This will update existing resources.
# Output: ‚úì Stack is in a stable state: UPDATE_COMPLETE
# Proceeds with update
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Script Hangs at Deployment

**Symptom:** Script shows "Monitoring deployment progress..." but doesn't proceed

**Solution:**
- Check CloudFormation console for stack status
- Press Ctrl+C to cancel
- Run `cdk destroy` if needed
- Retry deployment

### Model Access Denied

**Symptom:** `Access denied to model anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet`

**Solution:**
1. Go to Bedrock Console
2. Request model access
3. Wait for approval
4. Retry deployment

### Conflict Error

**Symptom:** `Stack is currently being updated`

**Solution:**
- Wait for current deployment to complete
- Check CloudFormation console
- Or cancel current deployment and retry

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test the improved script
2. ‚úÖ Try different models
3. ‚úÖ Review `MODEL_SELECTION.md`
4. ‚úÖ Deploy to production with Claude 3.5 Sonnet

---

## Summary

**What Changed:**
- ‚úÖ Script now waits for deployment completion
- ‚úÖ Added conflict detection
- ‚úÖ Easy model selection via `--model` flag
