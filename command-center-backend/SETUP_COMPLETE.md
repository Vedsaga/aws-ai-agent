# Task 1 Complete: AWS Infrastructure Foundation with CDK

## What Was Implemented

Successfully set up the AWS CDK infrastructure foundation for the Command Center Backend with the following components:

### 1. CDK Project Structure ✓
- Created TypeScript-based CDK project with proper configuration
- Set up `package.json` with all required dependencies
- Configured `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation
- Created `cdk.json` with CDK app configuration

### 2. Environment Configuration ✓
- Implemented multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
- Created `config/environment.ts` with environment-specific settings
- Added `.env.local` for local development configuration
- Configured cost alert thresholds per environment

### 3. IAM Roles with Least Privilege ✓
Created four IAM roles following the principle of least privilege:

- **UpdatesLambdaRole**: DynamoDB read-only access for the updates endpoint
- **QueryLambdaRole**: Bedrock Agent invoke permissions for natural language queries
- **ActionLambdaRole**: Bedrock Agent invoke permissions for pre-defined actions
- **ToolLambdaRole**: DynamoDB read-only access for the Bedrock Agent tool

Each role includes:
- AWS Lambda basic execution policy for CloudWatch Logs
- Specific permissions scoped to required resources only
- Proper service principal trust relationships

### 4. Main CDK Stack ✓
Created `CommandCenterBackendStack` with:
- DynamoDB table placeholder (basic structure for task 2)
- API Gateway placeholder (basic structure for task 9)
- Cost monitoring with CloudWatch alarms
- SNS topic for cost alerts
- Proper tagging and naming conventions
- CloudFormation outputs for key resources

### 5. Cost Monitoring ✓
Implemented cost controls:
- CloudWatch alarm for estimated charges (threshold: $50)
- SNS topic for cost alert notifications
- Email subscription for alerts
- Configurable per environment

### 6. Deployment Scripts ✓
Created helper scripts:
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: Automated deployment script
- `scripts/validate.sh`: Pre-deployment validation script
- Both scripts include error checking and colored output

### 7. Documentation ✓
- Comprehensive README.md with setup and deployment instructions
- Inline code comments explaining key decisions
- Environment configuration examples

## Requirements Satisfied

✓ **Requirement 7.1**: Serverless architecture with automatic scaling
- IAM roles created for Lambda functions
- DynamoDB table configured with on-demand billing
- API Gateway configured for automatic scaling

✓ **Requirement 7.2**: Cost efficiency with scale-down capability
- Pay-per-request billing for DynamoDB
- Serverless Lambda functions (no idle costs)
- Cost monitoring with $50 threshold alarm
- SNS notifications for budget alerts

## Next Steps

The infrastructure foundation is ready. Next tasks:

1. **Task 2**: Implement DynamoDB table schema with GSI
2. **Task 3**: Build data population script
3. **Task 4-8**: Implement Lambda functions
4. **Task 9**: Configure API Gateway routes
5. **Task 10**: Add comprehensive monitoring

## How to Deploy

```bash
cd command-center-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Validate setup
./scripts/validate.sh

# Deploy to dev environment
STAGE=dev npm run deploy

# Or use the deployment script
STAGE=dev ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Verification

All TypeScript files compile without errors:
- ✓ bin/app.ts
- ✓ config/environment.ts
- ✓ lib/command-center-backend-stack.ts

The CDK stack is ready to be deployed and will create:
- 4 IAM roles with least privilege
- 1 DynamoDB table (basic structure)
- 1 API Gateway REST API (basic structure)
- 1 SNS topic for cost alerts
- 1 CloudWatch alarm for cost monitoring
