# Task 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented task 3 "Build data population script" with both sub-tasks completed.

## Completed Sub-tasks

### ‚úÖ 3.1 Create simulation data generation script
**File**: `scripts/generate-simulation-data.ts`

**Implementation Details:**
- Generates 420 realistic disaster response events across 7 days
- Covers all 5 domains: MEDICAL, FIRE, STRUCTURAL, LOGISTICS, COMMUNICATION
- Includes all 4 severity levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- Creates GeoJSON geometries (Points and Polygons) for map visualization
- Distributes events realistically across Turkish earthquake-affected cities
- Uses realistic timestamps distributed throughout each day
- Event distribution tapers from Day 0 (75 events) to Day 6 (20 events)

**Key Features:**
- Event templates for each domain with appropriate resources
- Geographic distribution around 10 affected Turkish cities
- Random point generation within city radius
- Polygon generation for area-based events
- UUID generation for unique event IDs
- ISO 8601 timestamp generation

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ Compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ Exports `generateSimulationData()` function
- ‚úÖ Can be run standalone or imported

### ‚úÖ 3.2 Implement database population logic
**File**: `scripts/populate-database.ts`

**Implementation Details:**
- Batch-writes events to DynamoDB using AWS SDK v3
- Partitions events by day (DAY_0 through DAY_6)
- Validates all data before insertion
- Comprehensive progress logging with visual indicators
- Robust error handling with retry logic

**Key Features:**
- **Batch Writing**: Uses DynamoDB BatchWriteCommand with 25 items per batch
- **Validation**: Validates Day format, domain, severity, and GeoJSON before insertion
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with up to 3 retries for failed writes
- **Unprocessed Items**: Automatically handles and retries unprocessed items
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates per day and batch
- **Statistics**: Displays summary of events by domain and day
- **Performance Metrics**: Shows duration and events/sec throughput

**Error Handling:**
- Invalid event detection and logging
- DynamoDB operation failures with retry
- Unprocessed items handling
- Network error recovery
- Graceful exit on fatal errors

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ Compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ Exports `populateDatabase()` function
- ‚úÖ Can be run standalone or imported

## Additional Files Created

### üìÑ scripts/README.md
Comprehensive documentation including:
- Script descriptions and usage
- Event distribution details
- Environment variables
- Output examples
- Data model reference
- Workflow guide
- Error handling documentation
- Troubleshooting guide

### üì¶ package.json Updates
Added npm scripts:
- `npm run generate-data`: Run data generation script
- `npm run populate-db`: Run database population script

### ‚öôÔ∏è tsconfig.json Updates
- Added `scripts/**/*` to include paths for TypeScript compilation

## Requirements Verification

### ‚úÖ Requirement 5.1: Simulation Timeline Data Storage
- All events from 7-day simulation timeline are generated
- Events include all required attributes (eventId, timestamp, domain, severity, geojson, summary)
- Events are partitioned by day for efficient querying

### ‚úÖ Requirement 5.2: Efficient Query Patterns
- Events partitioned by Day (PK) for efficient time-range queries
- Timestamps in ISO 8601 format for sort key usage
- Domain attribute included for GSI filtering

## Testing Recommendations

Before deploying to production:

1. **Unit Tests** (Optional):
   - Test event generation with various parameters
   - Test validation logic with invalid data
   - Test batch chunking logic

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Deploy CDK stack to create DynamoDB table
   - Run population script against test table
   - Verify all 420 events are inserted
   - Query events by day and domain
   - Verify GeoJSON format is valid

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure population time for 420 events
   - Test with larger datasets (1000+ events)
   - Monitor DynamoDB throttling

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Build the project
```bash
cd command-center-backend
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Deploy infrastructure (if not already deployed)
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Step 3: Populate the database
```bash
npm run populate-db
```

### Step 4: Verify data
Check DynamoDB console or query the table to verify 420 events across 7 days.

## Next Steps

The data population scripts are complete and ready for use. The next tasks in the implementation plan are:

- **Task 4**: Implement updatesHandlerLambda
- **Task 5**: Create databaseQueryToolLambda for Bedrock Agent
- **Task 6**: Configure Amazon Bedrock Agent

These tasks will build upon the data structure created by these scripts.
