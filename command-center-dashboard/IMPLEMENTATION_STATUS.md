# Implementation Status

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Scaffolding ✅

- [x] Initialize Next.js project
- [x] Install dependencies: `mapbox-gl`, `zustand`, `axios`, `shadcn-ui`
- [x] Set up ShadCN/UI components (Button, Input, Card, Slider)
- [x] Create project folder structure: `/components`, `/services`, `/store`, `/data`
- [x] Create initial dummy data JSON files based on defined structure

## Phase 2: Static Layout & Component Shells ✅

- [x] Build the main layout to create the 80/20 split screen
- [x] Create placeholder components for `MapComponent`, `ChatPanel`, `AlertsPanel`, and `TimelineSlider`
- [x] Position the components correctly within the layout
- [x] Style the `ChatPanel` with an input field and message history area using ShadCN components

## Phase 3: State Management & Core Logic ✅

- [x] Implement the Zustand store (`/store/useStore.ts`) with the defined state structure
- [x] Create the `mockApiService.ts` with functions that read from dummy JSON files
- [x] In `MapComponent.tsx`:
  - [x] Initialize the Mapbox map on component mount
  - [x] Subscribe to the store and create a `useEffect` to update the map whenever `mapLayers` changes
  - [x] Implement the logic to handle `REPLACE` and `APPEND` actions
  - [x] Implement the auto-zoom logic using `viewState.bounds`
- [x] In `ChatPanel.tsx`:
  - [x] Wire up the input field to call the `mockApiService.postQuery` function
  - [x] On receiving a response, update the Zustand store
  - [x] Render the `chatHistory` from the store

## Phase 4: Integration & Final Polish ✅

- [x] Implement the `TimelineSlider.tsx` component and connect it to the store
- [x] Implement the 5-second polling mechanism using `setInterval` to call `mockApiService.getUpdates`
- [x] Implement the `AlertsPanel.tsx` to display `criticalAlerts` from the store
- [x] Add loading indicators that are triggered by the `isLoading` state in the store
- [x] Test session persistence by storing and retrieving the `timestamp` from `localStorage`
- [x] Final UI styling and cleanup

## Additional Deliverables ✅

- [x] README.md with comprehensive documentation
- [x] SETUP.md with quick start guide
- [x] .env.local for environment configuration
- [x] Three complete dummy data JSON files:
  - [x] initial_load.json
  - [x] food_water_response.json
  - [x] update_poll.json

## Functional Requirements Coverage

### R1: Map Display ✅
- [x] R1.1: Map centered on Nurdağı, Turkey (37.17, 37.07)
- [x] R1.2: Multiple data layers simultaneously
- [x] R1.3: GeoJSON rendering (Point, Polygon, LineString)
- [x] R1.4: Auto-zoom to `viewState.bounds`

### R2: Chat Interface ✅
- [x] R2.1: Display conversation history
- [x] R2.2: Text input for new messages
- [x] R2.3: Clickable "Suggested Action" buttons from `uiContext`

### R3: Real-Time Data Flow ✅
- [x] R3.1: Initial load with default view
- [x] R3.2: Poll data updates endpoint every 5 seconds
- [x] R3.3: Append new data according to `activeDomainFilter`
- [x] R3.4: Display critical alerts in dedicated panel

### R4: Timeline Control ✅
- [x] R4.1: Slider representing 7-day timeline
- [x] R4.2: Dragging slider triggers full data refresh

### R5: Session Persistence ✅
- [x] R5.1: Save timeline position to localStorage
- [x] R5.2: Resume from last saved position on refresh

## Architecture Highlights

### Unidirectional Data Flow
1. User interacts with component
2. Component calls API service
3. API service updates Zustand store
4. Store notifies subscribed components
5. Components re-render with new data

### Component Structure
```
App (page.tsx)
├── MapComponent (80% width)
└── InteractionPanel (20% width)
    ├── AlertsPanel
    ├── ChatPanel
    └── TimelineSlider
```

### State Management
- Centralized Zustand store
- Automatic localStorage persistence
- Reactive updates to all subscribers

### Mock API Strategy
- Three JSON files simulate different scenarios
- Deterministic responses based on query content
- Random updates for realistic polling behavior

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm run dev` successfully
- [ ] Map loads and displays initial incidents
- [ ] Chat input accepts and sends messages
- [ ] Suggested actions appear and are clickable
- [ ] Timeline slider updates simulation time
- [ ] Alerts appear in the alerts panel
- [ ] Page refresh restores timeline position
- [ ] Real-time polling adds new data every 5 seconds
- [ ] Map auto-zooms to fit new data bounds
- [ ] All TypeScript types are correct (no errors)

## Known Limitations

1. **Mapbox Token**: Uses placeholder token - replace with real token for production
2. **Mock Data**: Limited to 3 scenarios - expand as needed
3. **Error Handling**: Basic error logging - enhance for production
4. **Accessibility**: Basic implementation - add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for desktop - needs mobile breakpoints

## Future Enhancements

1. Replace mock API with real backend integration
2. Add user authentication
3. Implement data filtering and search
4. Add export functionality for reports
5. Enhance map interactions (click, hover, popups)
6. Add more visualization types (heatmaps, clusters)
7. Implement WebSocket for true real-time updates
8. Add unit and integration tests
9. Optimize performance for large datasets
10. Add accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
