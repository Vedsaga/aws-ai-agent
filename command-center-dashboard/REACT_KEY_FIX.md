# React Key Warning Fix âœ…

## The Error

```
Encountered two children with the same key: 'alert_045'
Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates.
```

## Root Cause

The polling mechanism was adding the same alert multiple times because:
1. The mock API returns the same alert every time
2. No duplicate checking was in place
3. React saw multiple elements with the same `alertId` key

## The Fix

### 1. Added Duplicate Check in Store
**File:** `store/useStore.ts`

```typescript
addCriticalAlert: (alert) => set((state) => {
  // Check if alert already exists
  const exists = state.criticalAlerts.some(a => a.alertId === alert.alertId);
  if (exists) return state;
  return { criticalAlerts: [...state.criticalAlerts, alert] };
}),
```

Now alerts with the same `alertId` won't be added twice.

### 2. Made Keys More Unique
**File:** `components/AlertsPanel.tsx`

```typescript
// Before:
<Card key={alert.alertId} ...>

// After:
<Card key={`${alert.alertId}-${index}`} ...>
```

This ensures each rendered alert has a unique key, even if somehow duplicates exist.

### 3. Fixed useEffect Dependencies
**File:** `app/page.tsx`

Added proper dependencies to the polling useEffect to prevent stale closures.

## âœ… Result

- No more React key warnings
- Alerts are only added once
- Each alert has a unique key
- Proper React hooks dependencies

## ðŸš€ Ready to Run

```bash
cd command-center-dashboard
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

The app should now run without any warnings or errors!
