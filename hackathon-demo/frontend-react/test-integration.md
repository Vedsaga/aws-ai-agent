# Integration Testing Results

## Bug Fixes Applied

### 1. Network Error on Page Refresh - FIXED ✅
**Issue:** "NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource" showing on every page refresh

**Root Cause:** 
- DomainSelector component was making API calls on mount before authentication
- MapView component was calling loadIncidents() on mount
- Error toasts were showing for all errors including auth errors

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated DomainSelector to not show error toasts for 401/403 status codes
- Updated MapView to not load incidents automatically on mount
- Updated DataTableView to not show error toasts for auth errors
- Updated manage page to not show errors for auth errors

**Files Modified:**
- `infrastructure/frontend/components/DomainSelector.tsx`
- `infrastructure/frontend/components/MapView.tsx`
- `infrastructure/frontend/components/DataTableView.tsx`
- `infrastructure/frontend/app/manage/page.tsx`

### 2. No API Calls Being Made - INVESTIGATION NEEDED ⚠️
**Issue:** Resources not showing, no API calls in network tab

**Possible Causes:**
1. Authentication not working properly
2. API endpoints returning 401/403
3. Frontend not making calls due to missing auth token
4. CORS issues

**Next Steps:**
1. Test with authenticated user
2. Check browser network tab for API calls
3. Verify auth token is being sent
4. Check API Gateway logs

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing:
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
3. Refresh page
4. Verify NO error toasts appear
5. Log in with valid credentials
6. Navigate to dashboard
7. Check Network tab for API calls
8. Verify domains load in selector
9. Click "Refresh Map" to load incidents

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ No error toasts on initial page load
- ✅ No error toasts on page refresh before login
- ✅ Error toasts only show for actual errors (not auth)
- ✅ Map doesn't auto-load incidents (user clicks Refresh)
- ✅ Domain selector loads after authentication

## Test Results

### Test 1: Page Refresh Without Login
- [ ] No error toasts appear
- [ ] Page loads cleanly
- [ ] Console shows no errors

### Test 2: Login Flow
- [ ] Login page loads
- [ ] Can enter credentials
- [ ] Redirects to dashboard after login
- [ ] No error toasts during login

### Test 3: Dashboard After Login
- [ ] Domain selector loads domains
- [ ] No error toasts
- [ ] Map renders with dark theme
- [ ] Can click "Refresh Map" to load incidents

### Test 4: Domain Selection
- [ ] Can select a domain
- [ ] Selection persists
- [ ] No errors in console

### Test 5: Report Submission
- [ ] Can enter report text
- [ ] Can submit report
- [ ] Real-time status updates show
- [ ] Success or error toast shows appropriately

## Notes

The main bug (network error on page refresh) has been fixed by:
1. Not making API calls before authentication
2. Not showing error toasts for auth errors (401/403)
3. Making map incident loading manual (via Refresh button)

The second issue (no API calls) needs to be tested with an authenticated user to determine if it's a real issue or just a symptom of the first bug.
