## üìä Current Status

**Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ 100% Deployed  
**Functionality**: ‚ùå 4.2% Working  
**Documentation**: ‚úÖ Complete

## üîç What Happened?

The deployment was successful - all AWS resources were created correctly. However, the Lambda functions cannot execute due to missing Python dependencies (psycopg module). This is a configuration issue in the CDK stack, not a code issue.

---

## üöÄ How to Fix

Follow the **[DEPLOYMENT_FIX_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_FIX_GUIDE.md)** which provides:

1. **Issue #1**: Missing psycopg module ‚Üí Use PythonFunction construct
2. **Issue #2**: DB-Init timeout ‚Üí Fix VPC configuration  
3. **Issue #3**: Report API auth error ‚Üí Verify authorizer
4. **Issue #4**: Database not seeded ‚Üí Use Lambda for seeding

Each issue has:
- Problem description
- Root cause analysis
- Step-by-step solution
- Verification commands

## üìà Test Results

```
Total Tests: 24
Passed: 1 (4.2%)
Failed: 12 (50.0%)
Skipped: 11 (45.8%)

Demo Readiness: ‚úó NOT READY

## üîß Quick Fix Commands

### 1. Install CDK Python Module
```bash
cd infrastructure
npm install @aws-cdk/aws-lambda-python-alpha
```

### 2. Update CDK Stack
Edit `lib/stacks/api-stack.ts` to use PythonFunction (see fix guide)

### 3. Redeploy
```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
cdk deploy MultiAgentOrchestration-dev-Api --require-approval never
```

### 4. Test
```bash
python3 TEST.py --mode deployed
```

**Expected**: 100% pass rate after fixes
