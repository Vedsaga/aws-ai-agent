- ✅ Authentication flow properly integrated
- ✅ Error responses handled gracefully

---

## Performance Considerations

### Identified Optimizations
1. ✅ API client initialization cached to prevent multiple calls
2. ✅ Agent list refresh uses key-based re-rendering
3. ✅ Retry logic prevents excessive API calls
4. ✅ WebSocket subscriptions properly cleaned up

### Potential Improvements
1. Consider adding pagination for large agent/domain lists
2. Consider caching agent/domain lists with TTL
3. Consider debouncing form inputs in agent creation

---

## Security Assessment

### Security Features Verified
- ✅ JWT token included in all API requests
- ✅ Built-in agents cannot be modified or deleted
- ✅ Custom agents can only be deleted by creator
- ✅ Input validation in agent form (max 5 fields)
- ✅ Auth session properly managed

### Security Recommendations
1. Verify rate limiting on agent/domain creation
2. Verify input sanitization on backend
3. Verify CORS configuration is restrictive
